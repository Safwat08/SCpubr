This package aims to provide a streamlined way of generating publication ready plots for known **S**ingle-**C**ell visualizations in a "**pub**lication **r**eady" format (**SCpubr**). This is, the aim is to automatically generate plots with the highest quality possible, that can be used right away or with minimal modifications for a research article. 


For further information read the [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.28.482303v1).

For installation and tutorials consult the [reference manual](https://enblacar.github.io/SCpubr-book/).

**SCpubr is still under development. A near future CRAN release of v0.1.0 is planned.**

	abstract = {Single Cell transcriptomic analysis has become a widespread technology of choice when it comes to understanding the differences at a transcriptomic level in heterogeneous samples. As a consequence, a plethora of analysis tools have been published to tackle the different analysis steps from count matrix generation to downstream analysis. Many of them provide ways to generate visualizations of the data. While some design choices are made, it is a common practice to provide the user with visualizations as raw as possible so that they can be customized to the user needs. However, in many cases these final customization steps are either time consuming or demand a very specific set of skills. This problem is addressed by {SCpubr}, which sacrifices some of this initial freedom of choice in aesthetics to provide the user a more streamlined way of generating high quality Single Cell transcriptomic visualizations.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},
