# Submission version 2.0.1
Fixed Startup messages and loading time at startup.

The package no longer calls for any mirrors to check package versions. I have removed every instance of this.

While `devtools::check` returns no warnings, `R CMD CHECK` does return:
â”€  checking package dependencies ...Warning: unable to access index for repository https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/bioc/src/contrib: (3s)
     cannot open URL 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/bioc/src/contrib/PACKAGES'
   Warning: unable to access index for repository https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/data/annotation/src/contrib:

     cannot open URL 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/data/experiment/src/contrib/PACKAGES'
     
For which I am unable to locate the exact reason why it only appears there. Would it be possible to receive guidance on this if this
turns out to be a real problem?
