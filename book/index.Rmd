# Aim of the package
This package aims to provide a streamlined way of generating publication ready figures for known single-cell visualizations. As subjective as the term "aesthetically pleasant" can be, this a set of theme modifications implemented across different plot types. This package also serves as a personal project, with future prospects of growth.
