# Aim of the package
This package aims to provide a streamlined way of generating publication ready figures for known single-cell visualizations. As subjective as the term "aesthetically pleasant" can be, this a set of theme modifications implemented across different plot types. This package also serves as a personal project, with future prospects of growth.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages

  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
