\description{
This plot aims to show the relationships between distinct enrichment scores. If 3 variables are provided, the relationship is between the Y axis and the dual X axis.
If 4 variables are provided, each corner of the plot represents how enriched the cells are in that given list. How to interpret this? In a 3-variable plot, the Y axis
just means one variable. The higher the cells are in the Y axis the more enriched they are in that given variable. The X axis is a dual parameter one. Cells falling
into each extreme of the axis are highly enriched for either x1 or x2, while cells falling in between are not enriched for any of the two. In a 4-variable plot, each corner
shows the enrichment for one of the 4 given features. Cells will tend to locate in either of the four corners, but there will be cases of cells locating mid-way between two
given corners (enriched in both features) or in the middle of the plot (not enriched for any).
